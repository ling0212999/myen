         * Last week I went to the theatre.
         * I had a very good seat.
         * The play was very interesting.
         * I did not enjoy it.
         * A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.
         * They were talking loudly.
         * I got very angry.
         * I could not hear the actors.
         * I turned round.
         * I looked at the man and the woman angrily.
         * They did not pay any attention.
         * In the end, I could not bear it.
         * I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.
         * 'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. 'This is a private conversation!'
